#
# It can be thought of as the "superclass" of all build specs.
#
# It can refer to $(name)s to get the name of the build spec without the
# ".spec" suffix (AKA the subclass's name).
#
# Use RFC 822 format


[DEFAULT]

# The target name that will be passed to various commands.
#
# Could be a board (in legacy mode), or a portage profile in the future.
#
# DEFAULT: the name of the subclass spec file, without the suffix
target: %(name)s
