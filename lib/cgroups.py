# Rough hierarchy sketch:
# - all cgroup aware cros code should nest here.
# - No cros code should modify this namespace- this is user/system configurable
# - only.  A release_agent can be specified, although we won't use it.
# cros/
#
# - cbuildbot instances land here only when they're cleaning their task pool.
# - this root namespace is *not* auto-removed; it's left so that user/system
# - configuration is persistant.
# cros/%(process-name)s/
# cros/cbuildbot/
#
# - a cbuildbot job pool, owned by pid.  These are autocleaned.
# cros/cbuildbot/%(pid)i/
#
# - a job pool using process that was invoked by cbuildbot.
# - for example, cros/cbuildbot/42/cros_sdk:34
# - this pattern continues arbitrarily deep, and is autocleaned.
# cros/cbuildbot/%(pid1)i/%(basename_of_pid2)s:%(pid2)i/

# An example for cros_sdk (pid 552) would be:
# cros/cros_sdk/552/
