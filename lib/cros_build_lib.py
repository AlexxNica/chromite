      shell must be false.
    print_cmd: prints the command before running it.
    error_ok: ***DEPRECATED, use error_code_ok instead***
              Does not raise an exception on any errors.
    error_message: prints out this message when an error occurs.
    redirect_stdout: returns the stdout.
    redirect_stderr: holds stderr output until input is communicated.
    cwd: the working directory to run this cmd.
    input: input to pipe into this command through stdin.
    enter_chroot: this command should be run from within the chroot.  If set,
      cwd must point to the scripts directory.
    shell: Controls whether we add a shell as a command interpreter.  See cmd
      since it has to agree as to the type.
    env: If non-None, this is the environment for the new process.  If
      enter_chroot is true then this is the environment of the enter_chroot,
      most of which gets removed from the cmd run.
    extra_env: If set, this is added to the environment for the new process.
      In enter_chroot=True case, these are specified on the post-entry
      side, and so are often more useful.  This dictionary is not used to
      clear any entries though.
    ignore_sigint: If True, we'll ignore signal.SIGINT before calling the
      child.  This is the desired behavior if we know our child will handle
      Ctrl-C.  If we don't do this, I think we and the child will both get
      Ctrl-C at the same time, which means we'll forcefully kill the child.
    combine_stdout_stderr: Combines stdout and stderr streams into stdout.
    log_stdout_to_file: If set, redirects stdout to file specified by this path.
      If combine_stdout_stderr is set to True, then stderr will also be logged
      to the specified file.
    chroot_args: An array of arguments for the chroot environment wrapper.
    debug_level: The debug level of RunCommand's output - applies to output
                 coming from subprocess as well.
    error_code_ok: Does not raise an exception when command returns a non-zero
                   exit code.  Instead, returns the CommandResult object
                   containing the exit code.
    kill_timeout: If we're interrupted, how long should we give the invoked
                  process to shutdown from a SIGTERM before we SIGKILL it.
                  Specified in seconds.

      remote=. (aka locals).  This is enabled by default, and is what allows
      developers to have multiple local branches of development dependent
      on one another; disabling this makes that work flow impossible,
      thus disable it only with good reason.  The value given controls how
      deeply to recurse.  Defaults to tracing through 10 levels of local
      remotes. Disabling it is a matter of passing 0.
