"""Wapper for the chromite shell.

This script is intended to run in several ways:
- Outside the chroot, it should be _copied_ to someplace that is in the
  path (like depot_tools).  It will search for the right chromite by looking
  for a file 'chromite/shell/main.py' upward based on the CWD.
- Inside the chroot, it might be _either_ copied to someplace in the path (since
  depot_tools is in the path in the chroot) or it might run from chromite/bin
  directly, which should be in the PATH.  In any case, we'll look for the
  real 'chromite/shell/main.py' based on the environment variable
  CROS_WORKON_SRCROOT, so it doesn't matter what the CWD is.

If you're looking at a copy and want to know where the original looks at, look
here:
  http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromite.git;a=blob;f=bin/chromite

Since this script is _copied_, it should remain small and not use internal libs.
