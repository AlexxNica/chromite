    This is the only place in chromite where legacy scripts are invoked. We
    aim to replace all calls to this method with a proper python alternative
    complete with unit tests. For now this allows chromite to do its job.

    We'll ignore signal.SIGINT before calling the child.  This is the desired
    behavior if we know our child will handle Ctrl-C.  If we don't do this, I
    think we and the child will both get Ctrl-C at the same time, which means
    we'll forcefully kill the child.

    The specified command will be executed through the shell.

    We'll put CWD as src/scripts when running the commands, since many of these
    legacy commands live in src/scripts.

    This code has come from RunCommand but we have removed the so-far unused
    extra features like input, entering chroot and various controls.

    Also removed is argument handling. This function does not handle arguments
    with spaces in them. Also it does not escape any special characters that
    are passed in. The command is executed with 'sh -c ...' so the limitations
    of that must be kept in mind.

    Args:
      name: A name for the script, as might be displayed to the user.
      cmd: Command to run.  Should be input to subprocess.Popen.
      args: list of arguments to pass to command.
      env: If non-None, this is the environment for the new process.
      shell_vars: If non-None, this is the shell variables to define before
          running the script.

    Raises:
      ChromiteError(msg) if subprocess return code is not 0.
      Args:
        msg: Error message
